###**Comparisons**

Famo.us is a full-fledged mobile app framework built around a physics engine.

GSAP is a richly-featured animation platform with a ton of power. GSAP is what inspired me to pursue the development of Velocity.

Velocity's focus is on being a very lightweight, very fast tool for drastically improving UI animation performance and workflow.

With each of these solutions, we're comparing options that are the product of nothing but love -- for performance and for the Web. Choose whichever is best suited to your task at-hand. They're all very fast.
