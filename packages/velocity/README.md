###**Comparisons**

Famo.us is a full-fledged *mobile app framework* built around a physics engine.

GSAP is a fast, richly-featured *animation platform*. GSAP is what inspired me to pursue the development of Velocity.

Velocity's focus is on being a very fast, lightweight tool for dramatically improving *UI animation performance and workflow*.

With each of these solutions, we're comparing options that are the product of nothing but love -- for performance and for the Web. Choose whichever is best suited to your task at-hand. They're all very fast.
