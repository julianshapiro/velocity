###**Comparisons**

Famo.us is a full-fledged *mobile app framework* built around a physics engine.

GSAP is a fast, multi-purpose *animation platform*. GSAP is what inspired me to pursue the development of Velocity.

Velocity's focus is on being a very fast, lightweight tool for dramatically improving *UI animation performance and workflow*.
