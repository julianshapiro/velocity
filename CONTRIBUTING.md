**Contributing**

- Make sure you're using the latest version of Velocity before reporting a bug.

- Unless you're reporting an obvious bug that can be immediately recreated by anyone, please **create a demo** with the minimum amount of code necessary to reproduce your bug. You can use this template, which already has Velocity and its UI pack included: http://jsfiddle.net/65xCP/4/.

- For a variety of reasons, I rarely merge pull requests. There is no need to make one; just explain your issue and I will take care of it. Thank you so much!

- Please skim the FAQ before asking questions: https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/issues/47.

- @ydaniv provides moderation support for Velocity's GitHub issues.
